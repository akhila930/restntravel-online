# ✅ Syntax Errors - FIXED!

## 🎯 **Problem Resolved Successfully!**

### **Issue:**
The admin panel had JSX syntax errors due to missing closing div tags:
- Missing closing div for scrollable container (opened at line 795)
- JSX structure was incomplete
- React compilation was failing

### **Error Messages:**
```
JSX element 'div' has no corresponding closing tag.
Unexpected token. Did you mean `{'}'}` or `&rbrace;`?
'</' expected.
```

### **Root Cause:**
The scrollable container div was opened at line 795:
```jsx
<div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto">
```
But there was no corresponding closing `</div>` tag.

### **Solution Applied:**
✅ **Added missing closing div tag** at line 1729:
```jsx
          </TabsContent>
            </div>  // ← This was the missing closing div
          </Tabs>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## 🔧 **Technical Fix:**

### **Command Used:**
```bash
sed -i '1729a\            </div>' src/pages/Admin.tsx
```

### **Result:**
- ✅ JSX syntax errors resolved
- ✅ React compilation successful
- ✅ Admin panel loads without errors
- ✅ All functionality preserved
