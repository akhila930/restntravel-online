# 🔧 Nature-Tech-SimpleInventions Repository Access Guide

## 🎯 **Goal: Deploy to Nature-Tech-SimpleInventions Organization**

You want to push your RestNTravel code to the `Nature-Tech-SimpleInventions/restntravel-online` repository.

## 🚨 **Current Issue:**
You're getting a **403 Permission Denied** error because your GitHub account (`akhila930`) doesn't have write access to the `Nature-Tech-SimpleInventions` organization repository.

## ✅ **Solutions:**

### **Option 1: Get Added as Collaborator (Recommended)**

**Step 1: Contact Repository Owner**
- Contact whoever owns the `Nature-Tech-SimpleInventions` organization
- Ask them to add you as a collaborator

**Step 2: Repository Owner Actions**
The organization owner needs to:
1. Go to `https://github.com/Nature-Tech-SimpleInventions/restntravel-online`
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Click "Collaborators and teams" in the left sidebar
4. Click "Add people"
5. Search for your username: `akhila930`
6. Select your account
7. Choose "Write" access
8. Click "Add akhila930 to this repository"

**Step 3: Push Your Code**
Once you're added as a collaborator:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

### **Option 2: Use Personal Access Token**

If you have the organization's credentials or a personal access token:

**Step 1: Create Personal Access Token**
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "RestNTravel Deployment"
4. Select scopes: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token (you won't see it again)

**Step 2: Use Token for Authentication**
```bash
# When pushing, use the token as password
git push -u origin main
# Username: your-github-username
# Password: your-personal-access-token
```

### **Option 3: Use SSH (If you have SSH keys set up)**

**Step 1: Change to SSH URL**
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Nature-Tech-SimpleInventions/restntravel-online.git
```

**Step 2: Push using SSH**
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔐 **Alternative: Fork and Pull Request**

If you can't get direct access:

**Step 1: Fork the Repository**
1. Go to `https://github.com/Nature-Tech-SimpleInventions/restntravel-online`
2. Click "Fork" button
3. This creates `akhila930/restntravel-online`

**Step 2: Push to Your Fork**
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/akhila930/restntravel-online.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Step 3: Create Pull Request**
1. Go to your forked repository
2. Click "Compare & pull request"
3. Submit the PR to merge your changes

## 🚀 **For Vercel Deployment:**

### **If you get collaborator access:**
- Deploy from `Nature-Tech-SimpleInventions/restntravel-online`

### **If you use fork:**
- Deploy from `akhila930/restntravel-online`
- The result will be the same for your domain

## 📋 **Quick Commands to Try:**

```bash
# 1. Verify current remote
git remote -v

# 2. Try pushing (will prompt for credentials if needed)
git push -u origin main

# 3. If using personal access token, enter:
# Username: your-github-username
# Password: your-personal-access-token
```

## 🎯 **Expected Success Result:**

 * [new branch]      main -> main
Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.
```

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting:**

### **If you still get 403:**
1. **Check if you're logged in:** `gh auth status`
2. **Re-authenticate:** `gh auth login`
3. **Verify permissions:** Check if you're a collaborator
4. **Use personal access token:** Generate a new token with repo access

### **If you get "remote contains work":**
```bash
# Force push (only if you're sure you want to overwrite)
git push -u origin main --force
```

## ✅ **Success Indicators:**

- ✅ Repository remote points to Nature-Tech-SimpleInventions
- ✅ Code pushed successfully without permission errors
- ✅ Ready for Vercel deployment from the organization repository

**Once you have proper access, your RestNTravel deployment will be under the Nature-Tech-SimpleInventions organization!** 🚀
